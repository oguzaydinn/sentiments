        "text": "We've likely hit a scaling wall in base models. For years, AI labs insisted that simply scaling up compute and data would lead to continuous intelligence gains, following the so-called \"scaling laws.\" Grok-3, reportedly trained on 100,000 H100 GPUs, should have been a major leap beyond GPT-4 and Claude 3.5. Instead, it's roughly on par with them. If brute-force scaling still worked as expected, we'd see something far more impressive.  \n\nDiminishing returns seem to be kicking in. More compute isn't necessarily making models smarter—it's just making them more expensive to train and run. There's also the data bottleneck. The internet isn't producing enough high-quality new data, meaning these models risk overfitting or hitting limits in knowledge absorption. Meanwhile, inference costs are rising exponentially. Even if a much larger model worked, deploying it at scale could be financially impractical.  \n\nThe silence from AI companies is telling. OpenAI and others spent years saying \"just scale up, and intelligence emerges.\" Now, suddenly, the focus has shifted to reasoning, efficiency, and multimodality, with almost no mention of making models bigger. Claude 3.5 Opus being quietly removed from Anthropic’s blog only adds to the suspicion. If they openly admitted that scaling has plateaued, it could rattle investors and disrupt their AGI narrative.  \n\nInstead of ever-larger models, the future seems to be in optimizing architectures. Mixture of Experts (MoE), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning on reasoning tasks are becoming the focus. Fine-tuning and synthetic data generation may compensate for the data bottleneck. OpenAI and others are likely betting that better reasoning mechanisms—not just more parameters—will unlock the next level of intelligence.  \n\nTL;DR: We probably have hit a scaling wall. Grok-3’s lack of a major leap despite massive compute suggests diminishing returns. AI companies shifting focus to reasoning and efficiency instead of larger models hints at a limit. They're likely keeping quiet to avoid damaging the AGI hype cycle. Expect a shift toward optimized architectures and reasoning improvements rather than just brute-force scaling.",

This raises a paradox: while AI contributes positively to the collective good, humans may exploit this cooperative behavior, resulting in a phenomenon known as freeriding. This illustrates the complex dynamics of trust between humans and AIs, showing that although AIs are designed to contribute positively, they themselves may become victims of exploitation by human participants. This observation challenges the traditional view that all actors in these scenarios act merely from self-interest, suggesting a more nuanced interplay between human and AI behavior in economic interactions.\n\n* [Which LLMs are greedy and which are generous?
